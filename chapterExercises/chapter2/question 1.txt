x = 2
y = 3
print('x =', x)
print('value of' , x, '+', x, 'is' (x + x))
print('x = ')
print((x + y), '=', (y + x))

The first statement implies that we should print the value of x, or the assigned value of x
The second statement implies that we should print the addition of x in two places that is 2 + 2 = 4
The first statement implies that x is a str
The last statement implies that we should print the add of both x and why and also the addition of y and x. The value of the first addition should be equal to the value of the second addition
